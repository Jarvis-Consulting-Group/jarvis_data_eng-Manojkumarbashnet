## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Manojkumarbashnet](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Manojkumarbashnet)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Manojkumarbashnet/tree/master/linux_sql)]: A Linux clustering agent is a viable product that seeks to keep track of the resources consumed by each node in the cluster as well as their hardware requirements. In this project, a PSQL instance is created using docker, and bash scripts are then used to perform commands to obtain hardware information and node memory utilization. By creating a PostgreSQL database connection, the data collected by bash scripts are added to the PostgreSQL database.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Manojkumarbashnet/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: In progress
  - JDBC App: This Core Java JDBC app involved learning and experimenting with the JDBC API by creating a basic Java application that would perform CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE) operations on an existing dataset within a database.
  - Grep App: Developed a Java 8 project utilizing Maven to search for text lines that match a particular pattern in all files under a directory. The project involves two different search implementations, one utilizing for loops and the other using Java 8 Stream/Lambda functions to achieve superior performance. Additionally, a logger library was employed to provide feedback on the search process. The application is designed to export search results to a file utilizing Java IO APIs.  Finally, I deployed the project within a Docker container and uploaded it to Docker Hub to facilitate its distribution.
