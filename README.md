**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Manojkumarbashnet/tree/master/linux_sql)]: A Linux clustering agent is a viable product that seeks to keep track of the resources consumed by each node in the cluster as well as their hardware requirements.In this project, a psql instance is created using docker, and bash scripts are then used to perform commands to obtain hardware information and node memory utilisation. By creating a PostgreSQL database connection, the data collected by bash scripts is added to the PostgreSQL database.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-Manojkumarbashnet/tree/master/core_java)]:
